# Wedding invitation website

React, TypeScript, and Vite single-page application for the wedding website. The site is statically hosted on GitHub Pages; personalized RSVP links open the full home page at its RSVP section, using tokenized paths without a client-side routing dependency.

## Development commands

Use Node.js 22.12+.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The Vite base path is generated from the configured bride and groom display names. On GitHub Pages, the couple path is also the project-site mount path, so the build output is deployed at the artifact root. The invitation and RSVP links use that base path, and `public/404.html` restores direct RSVP links. The deploy workflow runs the tests, builds `dist`, and deploys with GitHub Actions. Set **Repository Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

## Invitation opening music

The invitation opens behind an envelope intro on every page load. The background track is `public/music/wedding-music.mp3`; replace that file to use a different track. Its URL is resolved against Vite's configured base path for GitHub Pages. If the audio cannot load or play, the invitation remains usable and the music control stays hidden.

## RSVP configuration

No Apps Script URL or Google Sheet is configured. The RSVP UI shows a friendly not-open state until `VITE_RSVP_BRIDGE_URL` is set in a local, untracked `.env.local`. Never commit guest data, generated tokens, spreadsheet IDs, or deployment URLs. Review [docs/rsvp-setup.md](docs/rsvp-setup.md) before creating the private sheet and test deployment. A live iframe flow still requires manual verification against a user-created test deployment and test sheet.
